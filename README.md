# Gateway

This project offers a versatile library for constructing an API Gateway using Golang routers. Drawing inspiration from
the [Spring Cloud Gateway](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gateway), the library aims to simplify the
process of managing APIs.

## Getting Started

To integrate the Gateway project with your Golang application, follow the steps outlined below:

1. **Installation**: Begin by installing the Gateway library.
   You can either clone the repository or install it via a package manager like `go get`.

    ```bash

    ```
